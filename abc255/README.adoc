This is my first participating in a competitive programming contest!

It took me 55 minutes to answer the first two questions. *Haskell is a tough language*.

== What I learned

* Separate `solve` function from the `main` function.
** To separate the pure function from IO function.
** To use pattern match over input values.
** To use `where` expression.

* Make your cheatsheet for competetitive programming.
